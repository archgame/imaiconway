Quick DWG to Revit Lines:
It's more like our "Quick DWG to Revit Lines" tool, but instead of just working on the one CAD you have to select, it runs it on all CAD imports at once. Yah, I was thinking somehow including it in that tool. Like an option to batch run it on all imports, but by default, only a selected one.
Level Bubble Modifier
Grid Bubble Modifier to ARC

LineStyle:
The pyRevit one actually shows the line weight, color, and line pattern for each line. That one doesn't dig into model/detail groups, though. The CTC one doesn't show that info, but it does get into those model/detail groups. I usually run a pass through pyRevit first, then go to CTC for the deep swap. And just on imports. Leaving the linked CAD alone.
